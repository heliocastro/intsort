This is a simple sample test for sort classes.
It takes a random number of integers MAX_INTEGERS and sort  it using different algorithms.
Results are shown as number of iteractions took to the N element is sorted and time
to do that on every sort algorithm.
N can be any position where N <= MAX_INTEGERS.
Initially there are only a simple bubblesort of the book algorithm added

Command line options available

Usage::
  --help                This help message
  --elements arg        Set the amount of elements to sort. Default is 1000
  --position arg        Set the position. Default is 100
  --enable_debug        Enable trace debug of all iteractions
