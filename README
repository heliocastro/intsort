This is a simple sample test for sort classes.
It takes a random number of integers MAX_INTEGERS and sort  it using different algorithms.
Results are shown as number of iteractions took to the N element is sorted and time
to do that on every sort algorithm.
N can be any position where N <= MAX_INTEGERS.
Initially there are only a simple bubblesort of the book algorithm added

There's three command line options available

--help - Shows help message
--print_list - Print the sorted list of integers
--position - alters the position of iteractions to test. default is 100
