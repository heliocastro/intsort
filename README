This is a simple sample test for a sort class.
It takes a random number of integers MAX_INTEGERS and sort  it using different algorithms.
Results are shown as number of iteractions took to the N element is sorted and time
to do that on every sort algorithm.
N can be any position where N <= MAX_INTEGERS.
